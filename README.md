## Social and Interdisciplinary Context in Data Science
Data science is inherently interdisciplinary. It rarely exists by itself, and is instead applied to other industries. It is often used to analyze social topics, such as researching demographics or predicting behaviors. When using data about people, it is important to remember the context that the data exists in. If the data includes a marginalized group, this needs to be taken into consideration by the analyst. Is there a lack of data about them, does the minority need to be weighted heavier, and is the data even accurate or is it corrupted by bias? I'm hoping to learn how to utilize interdisciplinary knowledge to show a true reflection of the data I am analyzing.
